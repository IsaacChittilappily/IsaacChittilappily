# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Isaac

I'm a Computer Science student in Year 13 at The Judd School, currently juggling Maths, Physics and Computer Science. 

My interests in programming include Python (the best language!), especially it's applications in AI.

I also have a tutoring business - https://isaactutoring-obb2hw3.gamma.site
